## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    My tutor explained the basic syntax of html, CSS, and JavaScript for me. I also looked up some online resources to help me understand the process of web develeopment using html, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    One of the challenges that I faced in this submission is encountering html, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time. Getting to know how they interact with each other learning about their syntax was a bit daunting in the beginning, but I am getting more used to it as I use it more. I also had to understand how some JavaScript functions work, such as setTimeout() function. Going back and forth between the three files to connect different pieces of code was a new experience since I usually code in one programming language (Python, Java, C++). As I attempted to add extra features to the project, I was cautious to not create bugs in my already working code, which is a challenge all programmers face at a certain point. Adding photos was challenging because I had to look up how to use img and tags and do some reading about it to understand how to incorporate it into my project. Overall, the biggest challenge is pushing my abilities beyond its limit and having this growth mindset and the willingness to learn and improve.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

    I am wondering how to develop bigger and more complex websites since the one we designed was very simple. I am looking forward to learning about the different possibilities and functionalities that can be achieved using html, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to know the different built-in functions in JavaScript and when and how to use them. I am also curious to learn about the html tags and how can they be used to design and organize the web pages. I want to learn more about using CSS to customize my html code and give it different styles, shapes, and colors!

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    
    If I had few more hours to work on this project, I would spend it beautifying the final product. I would put some background music, some animating background, and try to make the visuals more appealing. For example, I would let the pop-up notifications appear in a nice-looking box. I would also give the player the option to choose difficulty and decide the number of buttons and the speed of the game. I would also give the player the option to change the theme of the game. Changing the theme would change the background music and the animation to correspond to the theme.
